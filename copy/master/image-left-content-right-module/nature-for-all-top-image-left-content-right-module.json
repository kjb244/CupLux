          "We believe that every business is responsible for postively contributing to the community it operates in. At Cuplux, this is embodied in our community philosophy \"Nature for All.\" Nature for All is the belief that every human being should be able to readily access nature regardless of where they live. In larger, metropolitan areas, accessing nature can be difficult, but the efforts of urban conservation groups can help improve accessibility to nature via parks, greenways, etc. Our goal is to help bolster existing conservation efforts in and around Charlotte --creating positive, visible impact."
