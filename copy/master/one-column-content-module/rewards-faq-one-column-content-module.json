You cannot use your Bloc Card balance on the purchase of brew equipment, gift cards or the replacement cost of a new card.  Your balance cannot be transferred to another account.  The balance expires 36 months after the purchase date.  Members are only allowed one card per person.  In the event you lose your card, you can have it replaced at the store for the cost of the card.    The 10% generated from a Bloc Card can only be put back on the same individual's card.  CupLux reserves the right to exclude other purchases it deems necessary.  Balances on a card can only be used at CupLux and cannot be exchanged for cash or credit of any other type. These terms are all subject to change."
