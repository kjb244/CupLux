        "Nature for All is the belief that every human being should be able to readily access nature regardless of where they live. In larger, metropolitan cities, accessing nature can be difficult, but the efforts of urban conservation groups can help improve accessibility to nature via parks, greenways, etc. Our goal is to help bolster existing conservation efforts in and around Charlotte creating positive, visible impact."

TreesCharlotte (TC)  is a non-profit organization working to preserve, increase and diversify our tree canopy here in Queen City. ",
        "Our#CanopyLove Campaign is the celebration and preservation of our beautiful tree canopy. We all have to do our part to preserve this gem for future Charlotteans.  Currently, our canopy covers 47% of the city and TC wants to get us to 50% by the year 2050 (50x50).  This will require the planting of over 500,000 trees!",
        "CupLux will be doing small community events, planting trees in both our neck of the woods (pun, very much intended) as well as in other parts of the city.  As our ability to make an impact grows, so will the frequency of these and other urban conservation events we help with.
