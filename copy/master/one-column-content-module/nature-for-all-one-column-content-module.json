Currently, <span class='purple strong'>our canopy covers 47% of the city and TC wants to get us to 50% by the year 2050 (50x50).</span>  This will require the planting of over 500,000 trees!",
        "CupLux will be doing small community events, planting trees in both our neck of the woods (pun, very much intended) as well as in other parts of the city.  As our ability to make an impact grows, so will the frequency of these and other urban conservation events we help with.  <span class='purple strong'>If you want to learn about how you can help TreesCharlotte with their 50x50 goal visit TreesCharlotte.org</span>",
