It’s a very simple program: You get 10% back on all purchases of food or drink at CupLux to use on a future visit to our shop. To obtain the card there is a $5.00 annual membership fee which goes to funding urban conservation efforts in and around the community that surrounds our shop. The best part is, use the balance whenever you please!"
