Once the roasted coffee arrives at our shop, we follow through with the entire process of farm to cup, by brewing coffees to the standards set by the Specialty Coffee Association of America.  What this means for you is a cup of coffee that is never sour or bitter - but just right. No more running to the sugar and cream station out of fear of a bad cup o' joe.  Ask your barista about specific coffees to help you decide which one is best for you."
